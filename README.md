# Exercise Correction with Pose Detection

This project utilizes computer vision techniques to help users correct their exercise form in real-time using webcam input. It employs the Mediapipe library for pose detection, identifying key body landmarks to provide feedback on exercise technique. The project includes two main functionalities: push-up correction and lateral raise correction.


## Required Dependencies

To run this project, ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed by executing the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

`pip install mediapipe opencv-python`
 
This command will install the required libraries: mediapipe for pose detection and opencv-python for computer vision tasks.

## Usage
To use the program:

  1. Ensure your webcam is connected and functional.
  2. Run the script and follow the on-screen instructions.
  3. Choose between push-up correction (enter '1') or lateral raise correction (enter '2').
